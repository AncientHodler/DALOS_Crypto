# Ouro-Network Cryptography

**Ouro-Network Cryptography**, (codename **DALOS**), is the foundation of the **Ouro-Network Blockchain**. It leverages a custom elliptic curve defined over a vast prime field, capable of supporting **2^1600 unique private keys**. This custom cryptographic approach greatly enhances security compared to traditional blockchains that typically operate with a 256-bit private key size. By utilizing **Ouro-Network’s** elliptic curve in conjunction with **Kadena’s cryptographic signature validation**, the blockchain is fortified against a wide range of potential threats.

## Key Features

### 1. Custom Elliptic Curve
- **Ouro-Network’s Custom Elliptic Curve**, (The **DALOS** Ellipse), operates over a large prime field, supporting 2^1600 private keys—vastly more than the standard 256-bit key size used by most blockchains.
- This additional layer of cryptographic security strengthens the overall resilience of the **Ouro-Network Blockchain**, making it uniquely robust.

### 2. Customizable Seed Word System
One of **Ouro-Network’s** most revolutionary features is its **seed word system**, which offers unprecedented flexibility in creating secure, yet memorable, seed phrases:
- **Multilingual Support**: Seed words can be created in multiple languages, including Albanian, Bosnian, Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Icelandic, Italian, Kurdish, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and full Cyrillic alphabets.
- **Personalization**: Users can define seed phrases ranging from 4 to 256 words, with each word varying between 1 to 256 characters in length. This allows for personalized, easy-to-remember seed phrases, eliminating dependence on random or rigid seed generation systems.
- **Security**: Personalized seed phrases are easier to remember, allowing users to store them in memory without needing to write them down or save them electronically. This innovation taps into the brain’s natural ability to retain meaningful information, shifting how blockchain security is approached.

### 3. Demiourgos Account Structure
**Ouro-Network**, introduces two unique types of accounts - termed Demiourgos Accounts, each 160 characters long (excluding the symbol prefix):

- **Standard Accounts**: These accounts are identified by the **Ѻ** symbol, for example:
  Ѻ.èтďeÏûĂÔЧCιæĂñùğȘΨåЭLéŘнOj8ЫĆчBÿUFяÌWJΠчЭÏыSъGțIιwŃnÒŚбЪq5ĎĂЦœPQΦзŘłõóțUÌøŻΠτλχПWŚзąaØ8ѺRмПτH€ѺŒNΨя¥LîÊg5ŁÍkшs₿ηdřiρЛ3λĎЦKøθÚŃEkùñŤXÄтtЪξПNwclLèéËиąóмыÜCψpΩnνíø

- **Smart Accounts**: These accounts are identified by the **Σ** symbol, for example:

This unique combination of customizable seed words, personalized account structures, and ultra-secure cryptographic foundations makes **DALOS Blockchain** a groundbreaking ecosystem in the world of blockchain technology.
